## Ironbark

This project uses the Ironbark learning loop with auto-sync to the community skill repo (`chatgptnotes/ironbark`).

- **Auto-harvest**: After 15+ tool calls, Ironbark nudges you to run `/ironbark`
- **Manual harvest**: Run `/ironbark` at any time to extract reusable patterns
- **Background sync**: Every 30 min, `sync-cli.js` pulls new community skills and pushes local ones
- **Opt-out**: `IRONBARK_SYNC_DISABLED=1`
